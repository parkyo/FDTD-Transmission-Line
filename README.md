# FDTD-Transmission-Line
FDTD (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-difference_time-domain_method#:~:text=FDTD%20is%20a%20time%2Ddomain,obtained%20with%20a%20single%20simulation.">Finite Difference Time Domain</a>) is a numerical analysis technique used to simulate electromagnetic wave. This technique is important for building a <strong>self-driving car</strong> as it allows analyze the stabillity of the sensor LIDAR that detects obstacles.

I successfully found the solution for FDTD algorithms and simulated the electric field and magnetic field on MATLAB. This solution was used to test the LIDAR sensors built by PhD. research students.
